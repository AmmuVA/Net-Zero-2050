# Impact Analysis of Renewable Energy Adoption in the UK to Achieve Net-Zero Goals by 2050

## Abstract

The UK has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. With increasing carbon emissions primarily from coal and fossil fuels, transitioning to renewable energy sources is crucial. This project analyzes various datasets related to energy usage and production in the UK to uncover trends and insights that can inform policy decisions and facilitate the transition to a net-zero world. Employing advanced machine learning algorithms and visualization tools like Power BI, we will utilize time series analysis to predict future consumption, production, and emission levels. The project aims to contribute meaningfully to the UK's net-zero goals.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries. You can use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure the datasets are in the correct format. The main dataset should be named net_zero_data.csv.
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Energy_Analysis.ipynb) and run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.
Visualizations: The results of the analysis will include various visualizations to help interpret the data and forecasts.
Data Sources
The datasets used in this project were obtained from the official website of the UK government. They contain information on energy usage, production, and emissions.

## Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Remove unnecessary columns, check for missing values, and interpolate missing data.
Visualization: Plot time series data for renewable energy and fossil fuels.
Time Series Decomposition: Decompose time series data into trend, seasonality, and noise components.
Time Series Forecasting: Apply the ARIMA model for predicting future energy consumption and production.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Random Forest Regressor: Implement a Random Forest model for additional prediction accuracy.
